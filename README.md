Conducting a security audit of a blockchain network involves reviewing its architecture, smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, and network infrastructure for potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors. Below is an example of how you might conduct an audit in code format, breaking down key areas you need to review:

### 1. **Smart Contracts Audit**
The audit of smart contracts is one of the most critical aspects of blockchain security. We will look at common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflow/underflow, and improper access control.

#### Example Audit Script for Smart Contract (Solidity)

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// Vulnerable example: Reentrancy and access control
contract VulnerableContract {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // Reentrancy vulnerability: withdrawal function is prone to reentrancy attack
    function withdraw(uint amount) external {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }

    // Integer overflow vulnerability: unchecked operations
    function deposit(uint amount) external {
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;  // Potential for overflow if too large
    }

    // Insufficient access control
    function ownerWithdraw(uint amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner");
        payable(owner).transfer(amount); // Lack of modifier for access control
    }
}
```

**Audit Checklist:**
- **Reentrancy:** Ensure functions that transfer ether do not allow reentrancy attacks. Use the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern or the `ReentrancyGuard` from OpenZeppelin.
- **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** Use Solidityâ€™s built-in SafeMath library or use versions >=0.8.0 where overflow/underflow is automatically prevented.
- **Access Control:** Use proper access control mechanisms such as `onlyOwner` modifiers from OpenZeppelin.
- **Gas Limit & Loops:** Ensure functions don't allow arbitrary gas consumption, especially loops that could run indefinitely.

#### Automated Smart Contract Audit Tool
Using a static analysis tool like [MythX](https://mythx.io/) or [Slither](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither) can help identify these vulnerabilities automatically:

```bash
# Using Slither to audit the contract
slither VulnerableContract.sol
```

### 2. **Consensus Mechanism Security Analysis**
The consensus mechanism plays a critical role in securing the blockchain network. We will analyze common mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for potential vulnerabilities such as 51% attacks, Sybil attacks, or long-range attacks.

#### Example of Consensus Mechanism Review:
```python
class BlockchainAudit:
    def __init__(self, consensus_type):
        self.consensus_type = consensus_type

    def check_pow(self):
        """
        Check for vulnerabilities in Proof of Work (PoW) mechanisms.
        Potential attack vectors:
        - 51% Attack
        - Selfish Mining
        """
        print("Analyzing Proof of Work (PoW) security risks...")
        # Check if difficulty adjustment is robust
        # Evaluate if rewards are being attacked by selfish miners

    def check_pos(self):
        """
        Check for vulnerabilities in Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanisms.
        Potential attack vectors:
        - Long-range attacks
        - Sybil attacks
        - Nothing-at-stake problem
        """
        print("Analyzing Proof of Stake (PoS) security risks...")
        # Check for staked validator distribution (centralization risks)
        # Evaluate slashing conditions and penalties for dishonest validators

    def audit(self):
        if self.consensus_type == 'PoW':
            self.check_pow()
        elif self.consensus_type == 'PoS':
            self.check_pos()
        else:
            print("Unsupported consensus type.")

# Example of auditing PoS
audit = BlockchainAudit('PoS')
audit.audit()
```

### 3. **Network Infrastructure Security**
The network layer must be secure to prevent attacks like DDoS, man-in-the-middle (MITM), or eclipse attacks.

#### Example of Network Infrastructure Analysis (Python)

```python
import socket
import requests
from urllib.parse import urlparse

class NetworkSecurityAudit:
    def __init__(self, node_ip, node_port):
        self.node_ip = node_ip
        self.node_port = node_port

    def test_port_open(self):
        """
        Test if the port on the blockchain node is open and can accept connections.
        Vulnerability: Open ports could expose the node to DoS or MITM attacks.
        """
        try:
            sock = socket.create_connection((self.node_ip, self.node_port), timeout=5)
            print(f"Port {self.node_port} is open.")
        except socket.error:
            print(f"Port {self.node_port} is closed or unreachable.")
    
    def check_https(self):
        """
        Check if the node uses HTTPS for communication to prevent MITM attacks.
        Vulnerability: Lack of encryption leads to MITM risks.
        """
        url = f"http://{self.node_ip}:{self.node_port}/status"
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print("HTTP connection is unsecured.")
        else:
            print("HTTPS secure connection is in place.")

    def audit(self):
        self.test_port_open()
        self.check_https()

# Example of auditing a node
node_audit = NetworkSecurityAudit('127.0.0.1', 8545)
node_audit.audit()
```

### 4. **Other Common Vulnerabilities**
- **Sybil Attack**: The network should have a way to prevent Sybil attacks, such as requiring a large amount of stake or computational work.
- **Eclipse Attack**: Ensure that the network has mechanisms to prevent a malicious node from isolating other nodes.
- **Transaction Malleability**: Ensure transactions are non-malleable by using appropriate hash functions.

### Final Security Report Example (Python)

```python
class FinalAuditReport:
    def __init__(self):
        self.smart_contract_vulnerabilities = []
        self.consensus_vulnerabilities = []
        self.network_vulnerabilities = []

    def add_smart_contract_issue(self, issue):
        self.smart_contract_vulnerabilities.append(issue)

    def add_consensus_issue(self, issue):
        self.consensus_vulnerabilities.append(issue)

    def add_network_issue(self, issue):
        self.network_vulnerabilities.append(issue)

    def generate_report(self):
        print("----- Security Audit Report -----")
        print("Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:")
        for issue in self.smart_contract_vulnerabilities:
            print(f"- {issue}")

        print("Consensus Mechanism Vulnerabilities:")
        for issue in self.consensus_vulnerabilities:
            print(f"- {issue}")

        print("Network Infrastructure Vulnerabilities:")
        for issue in self.network_vulnerabilities:
            print(f"- {issue}")


# Example of generating a report
report = FinalAuditReport()
report.add_smart_contract_issue("Reentrancy vulnerability in withdraw function.")
report.add_consensus_issue("Risk of 51% attack in PoW.")
report.add_network_issue("Port 8545 open, potential DoS risk.")

report.generate_report()
```

### 5. **Mitigation Recommendations:**
- For **smart contracts**, apply best practices such as using OpenZeppelin's libraries for access control and reentrancy protection.
- For **consensus mechanisms**, strengthen the decentralization of validators, use penalty schemes (e.g., slashing), and review difficulty adjustment algorithms.
- For **network infrastructure**, ensure the use of encryption (HTTPS/TLS), apply firewalls to block unauthorized access, and monitor for DDoS attacks.
